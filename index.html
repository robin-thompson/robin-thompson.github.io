I am a postdoctoral research assistant in mathematical epidemiology at the University of Oxford, and a stipendiary lecturer in applied mathematics at Lady Margaret Hall. This website
contains some information about my research and teaching.
<hr>
My research involves using mathematical models to represent the epidemiological or evolutionary behaviour of infectious disease outbreaks. This includes using statistical methods to estimate
the parameters associated with disease spread and pathogen evolution, and using the stochastic and deterministic models that I develop to generate forward projections. The main aims are not only to generate forecasts of
specific outbreaks, but also to understand how diseases spread so that forecasts can be made and control interventions can be planned with more precision.

If there is anything that you cannot find on this website, or you would like any more information, feel free to email me! I am always interested in new collaborations, so if you would like
to work together then please also get in touch!
